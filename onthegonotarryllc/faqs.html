    <ol class="center">
        <li><strong>What is a mobile notary service?</strong></li>

        <p>A mobile notary service is a convenient option where a notary public travels to a specified location, such as a home, office, or other agreed-upon place, to witness and notarize documents.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>How does a mobile notary differ from a traditional notary?</strong></li>

        <p>Unlike a traditional notary, a mobile notary travels to the client's location, offering flexibility and convenience for individuals who may find it challenging to visit a traditional notary's office.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>What types of documents can a mobile notary notarize?</strong></li>

        <p>Mobile notaries can notarize a variety of documents, including but not limited to real estate documents, legal forms, powers of attorney, and affidavits. The specific documents may vary by jurisdiction.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>How do I schedule a mobile notary appointment?</strong></li>

        <p>Scheduling a mobile notary appointment typically involves contacting the mobile notary service, providing details about the location, date, and time you need the notary, and confirming their availability.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>What identification and documents do I need to present to the mobile notary?</strong></li>
        

        <p>Typically, you will need to present valid government-issued identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Additionally, bring the documents to be notarized and any other relevant paperwork.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>Can a mobile notary notarize documents for international use?</strong></li>

        <p>Notaries are generally authorized to notarize documents for use within their jurisdiction. If the documents are intended for international use, it's essential to inquire about additional requirements and whether an apostille is necessary.</p>

        <br>

        <li><strong>What is the difference between notarization and legalization, and can a mobile notary assist with both?</strong></li>

        <p>Notarization involves verifying the authenticity of signatures, while legalization is a broader process often required for international documents. Mobile notaries may assist with notarization, but additional steps may be needed for legalization, such as obtaining an apostille. It's essential to clarify this with the mobile notary service.</p>
